1/ Make a project_folder(my_cmake) and create two file-- main.cpp and CmakeLists.txt
2/ What will be written in the file could be find by googling. Some sources are given in the following lines--
** https://riptutorial.com/Download/cmake.pdf
** https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/modern-cmake.pdf

3/ So right now the structure is --
my_cmake
	--main.cpp
	--CmakeLists.txt
now in this directory open a terminal and run the following command--
cmake . && cmake --build . && ./app
// Here ./app nothing but the executable file name which is written in the CmakeLists.txt file
Now the code will execute

4/ Another way is in the project_folder at first create a folder named "build"
5/ Then go to this build folder
6/ Open a terminal
7/ Execute consecutively--
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .
8/ Except "cmake --build ." you can also write "make". (omit the inverted comma)
9/ It will then create a executable file in the build folder.
